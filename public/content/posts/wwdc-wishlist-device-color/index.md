I had this [code on my GitHub](https://github.com/bogren/DeviceColor) for a while and figured I share it here as well.

With Apple’s Worldwide Developers Conference this week, wishes and guesses on what is going to be released
are all over internet. Personally, I want more of the private API to be made available for the public
to use. A few years ago I saw someone mention device color, and since then I really like the idea of
designing and building an app taking the device color into account.

What part of the private API would you like to see opened up for everyone to use?

⚠️ Don’t ship this code to App Store. Accessing the private API got a bit trickier with Swift, though it’s still possible. The code for [*DeviceColor* is available on Github](https://github.com/bogren/DeviceColor).
